# Network Tools Deux
A series of network tools I've put together focusing on network analysis and forensics.

* Port scanner - features a basic function that connects to a port at a given address and sends a short string. The output indicates if the port is either open or closed, followed by the first line of the header (which typically indicates the service running on that port).

Modeled after TJ O'Connor's implementation in _Violent Python: A Cookbook for Hackers, Forensic Analysts, Penetration Testers and Security Engineers_.
